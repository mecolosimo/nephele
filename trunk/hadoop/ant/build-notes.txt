BUILD NOTES


REQUIRED External Settings

For ant or ivy to contact external URLs through a proxy, the environment
variable
  ANT_OPTS
needs to be set with proxy hosts and ports.  For more information, visit the
and manual at
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/
and in the left panel, click on:
  Running Ant, then Environment Variables  (running.html#envvars)
or visit
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/proxy.html
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/inputhandler.html  under section
    PropertyFileInputHandler, Note.

Since the required values are site-specific, they are not included in build.xml.
If you wish to include them in build.xml, see:
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/setproxy.html

    export ANT_OPTS='-Dhttp.proxyHost=your.proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyHost=your.sproxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080'

If your site requires proxy settings, they may be included in ~/.bashrc or
~/.antrc or, for Windows, %HOME%\antrc_pre.bat.  For some details, visit the
ant manual (above) and in the left panel, click on:
  Running Ant, then Files (running.html#files)


All site-dependent ivy settings are in file ivysettings.properties.
YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO MODIFY THIS FILE IN ORDER FOR THE BUILD TO WORK.
