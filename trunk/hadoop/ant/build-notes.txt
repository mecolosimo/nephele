BUILD NOTES


REQUIRED External Settings

For ant or ivy to contact external URLs through a proxy, the environment
variable
  ANT_OPTS
needs to be set with proxy hosts and ports.  For more information, visit the
and manual at
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/
and in the left panel, click on:
  Running Ant, then Environment Variables  (running.html#envvars)
or visit
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/proxy.html
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/inputhandler.html  under section
    PropertyFileInputHandler, Note.

Since the required values are site-specific, they are not included in build.xml.
If you wish to include them in build.xml, see:
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/setproxy.html

For the MITRE Ft. Meade location, the required proxy settings are:
    export ANT_OPTS='-Dhttp.proxyHost=your.proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyHost=your.sproxy.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080'

If your site requires proxy settings, they may be included in ~/.bashrc or
~/.antrc or, for Windows, %HOME%\antrc_pre.bat.  For some details, visit the
ant manual (above) and in the left panel, click on:
  Running Ant, then Files (running.html#files)


All site-dependent ivy settings are in file ivysettings.properties.
YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO MODIFY THIS FILE IN ORDER FOR THE BUILD TO WORK.


Ivy Notes

ivy:configure loads default settings, etc.
ivy:resolve resolves files into its cache directory (see ivysettings.xml).
If resolution is successful, ivy:retrieve copies these files to ${ivy.lib.dir}.
  Option sync="true" will remove files no longer needed.
See:
  http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/trunk/ant.html  (using ivy from ant)
  http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/use/retrieve.html

Ivy caches information about artifacts in files named by properties
*.cache.ivy.pattern, substituting "ivy" or for [artifact] in patterns.  Thus
${short.form} = [artifact]-[revision].[ext] in file ivysettings.xml cannot be
used as the value for *.cache.ivy.pattern properties because files for one
artifact will overwrite files for a previous artifact with the same revision.


Date notes, from man date:

FORMAT controls the output.  Interpreted sequences are:

    %%     a literal %
    %a     locale's abbreviated weekday name (e.g., Sun)
    %A     locale's full weekday name (e.g., Sunday)
    %b     locale's abbreviated month name (e.g., Jan)
    %B     locale's full month name (e.g., January)
    %c     locale's date and time (e.g., Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005)
    %C     century; like %Y, except omit last two digits (e.g., 20)
    %d     day of month (e.g, 01)
    %D     date; same as %m/%d/%y
    %e     day of month, space padded; same as %_d
>>  %F     full date; same as %Y-%m-%d
    %g     last two digits of year of ISO week number (see %G)
    %G     year of ISO week number (see %V); normally useful only with %V
    %h     same as %b
    %H     hour (00..23)
    %I     hour (01..12)
    %j     day of year (001..366)
    %k     hour ( 0..23)
    %l     hour ( 1..12)
    %m     month (01..12)
    %M     minute (00..59)
    %n     a newline
    %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)
    %p     locale's equivalent of either AM or PM; blank if not known
    %P     like %p, but lower case
    %r     locale's 12-hour clock time (e.g., 11:11:04 PM)
>>  %R     24-hour hour and minute; same as %H:%M
    %s     seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
    %S     second (00..60)
    %t     a tab
>>  %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S
    %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday
    %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)
    %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)
    %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday
    %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)
    %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)
    %X     locale's time representation (e.g., 23:13:48)
    %y     last two digits of year (00..99)
    %Y     year
    %z     +hhmm numeric timezone (e.g., -0400)
    %:z    +hh:mm numeric timezone (e.g., -04:00)
    %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)
    %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)
    %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow `%':
-      (hyphen) do not pad the field
_      (underscore) pad with spaces
0      (zero) pad with zeros
^      use upper case if possible
#      use opposite case if possible

After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modi‚Äê
fier,  which  is either E to use the locale's alternate representations if available, or O
to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.
