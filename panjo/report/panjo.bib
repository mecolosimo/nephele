abstract={A new method called the neighbor-joining method is proposed
                  for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from
                  evolutionary distance data. The principle of this
                  method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic
                  units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total
                  branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs
                  starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as
                  well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can
                  quickly be obtained by using this method. Using
                  computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of
                  this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree
                  in comparison with that of five other tree-making
                  methods: the unweighted pair group method of
                  analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's
                  method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified
                  Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and
                  Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be
                  generally better than the other methods.}
